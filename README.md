To my dear T.A,
I have ADHD and am in ACME, I don't think online classes are my cup of tea haha. I do not envy your position right now. I've tried to format this screen to make it easier for you to grade through this quickly!


# Checkt.ai

## Specification Deliverable
### Elevator pitch

Cleaning Checks are just simply the worst - for everyone. Residents definitely do not like strangers walking into their room while they sleep or last-minute checks scheduled while their whole apartment is out of town (happened to me). Add on how inconsistent inspectors are and you see the nightmare.

Property managers do not like them either. Headache of planning and executing hundreds of separate inspections is just not worth it.

Checkt.ai is a novel ai-powered technology that allows residents to see their cleaning assingments and upload their own photos of the apartment. Ai image-recognition technology then automatically passes or fails the cleaning check. Checkt.ai is a reliable, easy, private, and consistent solution to this pain.
